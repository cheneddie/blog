 <pre>function f(text, i) {\\n      console.log(text.charAt(i));\\n  } \\n  var text = 'Here is a Long long text .........';\\n  f(text, 0);\\n  f(text, 1);\\n  f(text, 2);\\n  f(text, 3);\\n  f(text,

代表32位元，而\\\"abcdefghij\\\"十個字代表160位的內存100個字則相當於16K了，而一個文本遠遠超過這個數量\\n<h4>那怎麼辦呢?</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>善用JS的Object</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>example</p>\\n<p>const o = (object, i) =&gt;

一個64位元的內存，比起整個文本差多了吧!!!</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>關於語法</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>你可以寫</p>\\n<p>define(f\\n(lambda (x y g) (g x y)))\\ndefine(g\\n(lambda (x y) (+ x y)))\\n(f (1 2

立即下載，不妨礙頁面，不按照順序，所以不要修改在加載期間的DOM\\ndefer 延遲到文檔被解析後執行\\nsrc 須執行外部的文件</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>其他\\ncharset 指定字符，瀏覽器可能忽略\\ntype 默認text/JavaScript，自定義可能被忽略\\n<noscript

這會被當作空的對象\\n#Note\\n未聲明(宣告)的變量也會判定為undefined，如；typeof(age) == undefined 但未聲明調用會報錯</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>javascript\\n類型\\n分為兩種類型的值 1.基本類型:number, string, boolean, undefined, null;辦別用typeof\\n2.引用類型:object; 辨別用instanceof\\n作用域\\n作用域分為全局環境和函數局部環境，每次進入一個新的環境之後，就會創建用於搜索變量和對象的作用域鍊，而局部可以訪問包含局部及往上至全局，全局則否，優先查詢同屬環境之後再依序往局部尋找\\n回收機制\\n當局部的函數結束後，自動加入回收，全局則建議手動加入，此效能優化影響將越來越小，因為JS原本因為IE6含之前，都是採用固定達到一個指標就回收(4096個對象,64KB字串,256個變量)在IE7之後改為動態增加臨界值，底於15%就會加倍，如果回收了85%則回復默認值。</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//

f(a) {\\nconsole.log(a);\\n}\\nf(100);\\n</pre></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>內存調用出一塊填充函數數據並用f作為標示地址</li>\\n<li>調用f，並把整數100複製給f地址的內存並用a作為符號標示</li>\\n<li>輸出符號a儲存的數據</li>\\n<li>釋放符號a使用的內存</li>\\n</ol>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>但…如果是下面這樣的情況呢</p>\\n  <pre>function f(text, i) {\\n      console.log(text.charAt(i));\\n  } \\n  var text = 'Here is a Long long text .........';\\n  f(text, 0);\\n  f(text, 1);\\n  f(text, 2);\\n  f(text, 3);\\n  f(text, 4);\\n  f(text, 5); \\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n</pre>\\n- 跟上面範例1~4依樣，但是卻在3-4重複了6次，讓我們說白話。\\n- 在javascript裡面\\\"a\\\"代表16位元，整數 1 代表32位元，而\\\"abcdefghij\\\"十個字代表160位的內存100個字則相當於16K了，而一個文本遠遠超過這個數量\\n<h4>那怎麼辦呢?</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>善用JS的Object</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>example</p>\\n<p>const o = (object, i) =&gt; {\\nconsole.log(object.text.chatAt(i));\\n};\\nconst object = {\\ntext : ‘Here is a Long long text …’,\\n};\\nf(object, 0);\\nf(object, 1);\\nf(object, 2);\\n…</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>這樣我們就只是複製 o 一個64位元的內存，比起整個文本差多了吧!!!</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>關於語法</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>你可以寫</p>\\n<p>define(f\\n(lambda (x y g) (g x y)))\\ndefine(g\\n(lambda (x y) (+ x y)))\\n(f (1 2 g))</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>妳也可以寫較容易辨識的</p>\\n<p>const f = (x, y, g) =&gt; {\\nreturn g(x, y);\\n}\\nconst g = (x, y) =&gt; {\\nreturn x + y;\\n}\\nf(1, 2, g);</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>機制一樣，任君選擇</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>關於使用方式</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>example</p>\\n<p>const parse = (text, f) =&gt; {\\nlet match;\\nfor(let n=0;n&lt;text.length;n++){\\nmatch = /Hi/.exec(text);\\nif(match === null){\\nbreak;\\n}\\nf(match);\\n}\\n}</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>這裡我們循環一個文本並用正則提取的Hi，再來如何最佳化調用呢?</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>below</p>\\n<p>const greatFun = (text) =&gt; {\\nlet a = 0, b = 1, c = 2, d = “wow”;\\nparser(text, (match) =&gt; {\\nlet t = a + b + c;\\nconsole.log(t + d);\\n})\\n}</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>我們可以直接使用父函數的所有，效能就是一點一點優化的</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>以上是我學習<a

是一種圍毆的概念，大家一起打一個人。</li>\\n<li>Sync  是A打人 → B打 → C打 → D打</li>\\n<li>「Async的說法之所以沒有錯誤是因為 Async 的特性，所以可以做到圍毆的效果，但不是這並非Async 的本質。」</li>\\n</ol>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<ul>\\n<li>以下用對話來顯示<br>\\n我：特性是指同時做很多事嗎?<br>\\nW：async = 發出要求～收到結果 這中間我可以去做其他事情<br>\\nW：你填好單子送到櫃檯，然後……<br>\\nW：他辦完再叫你的號碼→Async<br>\\nW：要站在櫃檯等他辦完→Sync<br>\\nW：因為不用站在櫃檯等，你就可以跑很多櫃檯、送很多張單子出去,<br>\\n就有上面說的「圍毆」的效果。<br>\\nW：所以 sync/async 是在說單一櫃檯辦事員的運作模式。<br>\\nW：然後……<br>\\nW：在對方是 async 的前提下，有些事情還是要依序辦理，<br>\\n例如：先去開好戶頭，才把戶頭交給公司行政。<br>\\nW：那你腦內就要有個清單：<br>\\nW：等薪資戶開好，然後再去跟公司行政帳號。<br>\\nW：這個然後就是 promise 的 then<br>\\nW：再歸納一次：<br>\\nW：- sync/async 是指單一個要求or操作的運作方式。<br>\\n（你需不需要卡住等他做完）<br>\\nW：- promise 則是用來描述多個操作之間關係的方法。<br>\\n（可以應付 async，但也可以是 sync）<br>\\n總結一下自己的總共犯了哪些錯誤，並加以更正！</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Node.js的處理方式是Sync(x)</li>\\n<li>Node.js的處理方式是Async(0)</li>\\n<li>Async是一次處理很多需求(x)</li>\\n<li>Async是接收到需求，不用一直等到需求完成再執行其他需求(0)</li>\\n<li>Async與Sync的差別在於：發送需求的人是否需要等到需求完成才可以執行其他事情。</li>\\n</ol>\\n<ul>\\n<li>以上就是Async與Sync差異的介紹，希望這篇文章可以幫到所有曾經和我一樣搞不清楚Async與Sync的人！</li>\\n</ul>\\n\"}\n\n\n//
